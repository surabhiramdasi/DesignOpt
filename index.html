										<h2 class="major">Topology Optimization</h2>
										<p>Topology optimization is a powerful tool that can be used to expedite the ALD process. The design-analysis iterative process for complex components like cylinder heads, flywheel housings
											can easily take months, if not years. Also, some of the high stress, high deformation areas are not very intuitive to fix. Additionally, the typical approach to fix a lot of design flaws is 
											to add material to the structure. This can easily make the components a whole lot heavier than they need to be. Topology optimization helps reduce the number of analysis and design 
											iterations and can also be effectively used to reduce the weight of the components - only if the analyst ensures the correct loading and boundary conditions. Topology optimization is 
											typically used for simple components like lifting brackets, other accessory brackets since the loading and boundary conditions are straightforward. I was able to use topology optimization
											for a cylinder head to effectively improve the stiffness of the whole structure. Almost 75% of the stress locations showed major improvements after implementing the suggestions from the 
											topology optimization results. In addition to that, the new cylinder head design was ~10 kgs lighter than the baseline product. Also, these changes helped fixed problematic areas which were
											already iterated on at least 15-20 times using the traditional design-analysis iterative approach. Ansys topology optimization and VR&D Genesis are my preferred tools for any 
											topology optimization projects.

										<h2 class="major">Modal and Stress Analysis</h2>
										<p> As part of my current role, I have to regularly analyze different components for stress and deformation under specific loading conditions. The load application 
											requirements for different components varies based on their specific duty cycle and application. For instance, for a cylinder head or a block, the worst case loads 
											come from the combustion firing loads and thermal stresses. On the other hand, a component like flywheel housing is more likely to fail from transportation loads. For 
											a stationary energy unit like Solid Oxide Fuel Cell power generator, some of the critical loads come from seismic and wind loads. I regularly work on various engines  
											and components to formulate different loading and boundary conditions that make physical sense. Since I work on NPI programs, more often than not, the analysis procedures
											and pass/fail criteria have to be curated to reduce the ambiguity of the results.

										<h2 class="major">Engine Accessory Design</h2>
										<p>I have designed auxiliary engine components like oil pans, flywheel housings and lifting brackets in the Current Product space. I curated the Design Verification Plan and Report (DVP&R) for various
											components based on the changes that were being made to the design. I also have experience with designing plumbing options such as coolant lines and oil suction tubes.
											I have employed DFA and DFM principles while working on these designs. I am also familiar with Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Root Cause Analysis procedures.
